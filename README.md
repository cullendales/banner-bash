## About

Banner Bash is an online game developed in Godot using a combination of GDScript and C#. The primary objective of the game is to capture a flag object before your opponents and hold it for as long as possible. The player holding the flag will gain points over time and the player with the most points when a round ends wins the game. When a player has the flag they are not safe from the other players and must run, as the other players can hit them to make them drop the flag and then pick it up themselves. Multiplayer players will compete online to obtain a singular flag.

Banner Bash includes jumping, crouching, sprinting, hitting, and power-up mechanics. The power-ups give the player who obtains them a temporary speed boost or higher jump. Players must also manage their sprint meter, as players who run out of stamina must wait until it recharges to begin sprinting again.

The map in the game includes various objects and high points to help players avoid others and introduce some variety into gameplay. The flag begins at a central high point of the map.
